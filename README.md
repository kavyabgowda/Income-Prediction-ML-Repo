# Income-Prediction-ML-Repo

This Project demonstrates solving Income Predictions for datasets available in "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcd-ml-comp-201920-income-pred-group/data". Various methodologies are followed in this project to clean the data, process the data and fit the data to the best available model to get the error rate of 9.78k. The problem statement for this project is available at "https://www.kaggle.com/c/tcd-ml-comp-201920-income-pred-group/overview".

## Methodologies to be followed in using project:
Required Dependencies:
1.	IDE to run the python code(Ex. Spyder)
2.	Install below mentioned dependent packages using PIP installer.

```bash
numpy, pandas, sklearn
```
3. Execute Final_Submission_LightGbm.py in Python Console.

4. This code fit the data to LightGbm model. If required change the model parameters and check the accuracy of model.

5. Check the accuracy of model by executing the model.
